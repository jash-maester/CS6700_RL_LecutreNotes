\section{Explore-Exploit Dilemma}
The Bandit Problem brings the notion of `Explore-Exploit Dilemma'.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item The agent needs to explore enough to find a profitable action.
    \item Exploit according to the best observations made so far.
    \item If the agent keeps on exploiting after a certain period of time, it may not find the best optimal policy, though it may find a policy.
    \item The same argument is valid for always exploring agent.
    \item Hence there arises a notion of Dilemma.
\end{itemize}
